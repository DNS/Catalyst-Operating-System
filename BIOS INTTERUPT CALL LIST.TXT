int 10h



00h: executed after illegal division by zero

01h: executed after every instruc while the trace flag is set

02h CPU: NMI, (used by eg. by POST for mem errors)

03h CPU: the lowest non reserved interrupt, it is used exclusively
for debugging, and implemented by a debugging program

04h CPU: numeric overflow, usually caused by the INTO instruc
when the overflow flag is set

05h: executed when shift-PrintScrn is pressed, BOUND instruc
detects a bound failure

06h CPU: called when undefined opcode exception occurs.

07h CPU: called after executing FP instruction when no FPU 
coprocessor available

08h IRQ0: implemented by system timer component, called 18.2
times per second (once every 55ms) by the PIC

09h IRQ1: called after avery key press and release (as well as
during the time when a key is being held)

0Bh IRQ3: called by serial port 2 & 4 (COM2, COM4) when in need of
attention

0Ch IRQ4:  called by serial port 1 & 3 (COM1, COM3) when in need of
attention

0Dh IRQ5: called by HD controller (PC/XT) or LPT2 (AT) when in need of
attention

OEh IRQ6: called by FD controller when in need of attention

0Fh IRQ7: called by LPT1 (printer) when in need of attention
